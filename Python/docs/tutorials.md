# Tutorials

This section contains in-depth tutorials to guide you through specific workflows in QES.

*(Note: These are placeholders for now. In a full documentation setup, we would link to Jupyter notebooks or detailed walkthroughs.)*

## 1. Ground State of the Heisenberg Model

A step-by-step guide to finding the ground state of a 1D Heisenberg chain using Exact Diagonalization.

* Setting up the Hamiltonian.
* Understanding the output spectrum.
* Measuring spin-spin correlations.

## 2. Training an RBM for the Ising Model

Learn how to use Variational Monte Carlo to train a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) on the Transverse Field Ising Model.

* Defining the RBM ansatz.
* Setting up the VMC sampler.
* Monitoring energy convergence.
* Comparing results with exact values.

## 3. Quench Dynamics with TDVP

Explore time evolution in quantum systems. We will simulate a quantum quench and observe the propagation of correlations.

* Preparing an initial state.
* Defining the time-evolution operator.
* Running the TDVP algorithm.
* Plotting observables vs. time.
