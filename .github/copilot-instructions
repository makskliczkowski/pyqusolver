# ===============================================
# CODING STYLE
# ===============================================
# Follow the existing repository style:
#   - Clean indentation with spaces/tabs aligned before and after '='.
#   - Compact docstrings with minimal but informative comments.
#   - Mathematical notation in comments using ASCII only (no Greek letters).
#   - No extraneous decorations or “cute” variable names.
#   - Code must be fast, clear, and deterministic.

# ===============================================
# PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS
# ===============================================
# - Numerical paths should JIT-compile cleanly when asked and possible!
# - Avoid slow loops etc.
# - Use np.ndarray or jnp.ndarray consistently where relevant.
# - Preserve deterministic memory layout and minimal allocations.
# - Provide an optional logger argument for profiling or debugging where appropriate.

# !!!!!!!!!! important !!!!!!
# DON'T CREATE SUMMARY FILES IN THE END UNLESS I ASK
# DON'T CREATE UNNECESSARY FILES EVERYWHERE
# USE ONLY ASCI CHARACTERS - FOR MATH USE LATEX - then the strings in python are raw : r'...'
# Tell if you are going in the loop!
# NO COMMENTS IN THE CODE REGARDING MY QUESTIONS IN THE QUERY! ONLY LIKE YOU ARE CODING REALLY
# TRY TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU ARE DOING IN THE CODE AS WELL, ADD EXAMPLES IN THE FUNCTION DOCS
